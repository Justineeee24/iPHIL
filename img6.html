            <p>The most famous attraction in Badian is Kawasan Falls, a three-tiered cascade that features distinctly turquoise water. It is also one of the most famous waterfalls in the Philippines.

There are two ways to explore the falls. One is by choosing from the various canyoneering tours and having a journey for three to six hours from Alegria to Badian, and the other is by a short trek to the waterfalls.</p>

            <h3>SIMALA SHRINE</h3>
            <p>Nestled in the hills of Simala, Sibonga in Cebu is the Monastery of the Holy Eucharist, popularly known as the Simala Shrine and Cebu’s Castle Church. As the name title implies, the sprawling religious complex looks like a castle by the hillside. 

Simala Shrine first rose to popularity when the word spread about the miraculous Virgin Mary statue it houses. Several Catholic and Marian Devotees flocked to Simala to pay their respects and pray for miracles and the Virgin’s intercession.

As its fame increased, the church began a series of renovations that transformed its once humble chapel into a grand castle-like shrine. 

Today, Simala Shrine attracts foreign and local travelers. There is a testimonial hall wherein stories of devotees’ answered prayers are posted. You will also find a “Dagkutanan” (a candle-lighting area), where you can light multicolored candles and say a prayer.

If you don’t mind long queues, you can see and kiss the miraculous Virgin Mary statue up close. 

Whether you are a devout Catholic or you want to admire the scenery and see Cebu's Castle Church, you are welcome at Simala Shrine. Just observe silence and be respectful while you are on the premises.

Additionally, the shrine has a strict dress code. When you visit Simala Church, don't wear shorts, skirts, crop tops, or any body-hugging and revealing garments. You can join a historical excursion in Cebu with a stop at Simala Shrine if you want to visit other tourist spots as well.</p>

            <h3>MOALBOAL</h3>
            <p>A popular tourist spot on the province’s southwestern coast, Moalboal is best known for its Sardine Run. Imagine swimming amidst millions of sardines in crystal clear waters. If you’re lucky, you may even swim with turtles while snorkeling.

Travelers who experienced this underwater marvel have described it as a breathtaking and surreal experience. What makes this spectacle even more magical is the fact that the sardines don’t leave the shallows of Moalboal. You can experience them year-round, even with just a pair of swimming goggles.</p>
