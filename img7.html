            <h3>LAW-UY</h3>
            <p>Law-uy is a Davao food that many consider a sumptuous Filipino comfort food. It is a delicious vegetable broth with okra, squash, eggplant, taro, jute leaves, and patola (silk squash). You can also add malunggay leaves to this dish. The soup is clear, though slightly thick due to the addition of okra. Law-uy is simple, delicious, and nutritious.

This Davao delicacy pairs perfectly with rice and can warm you up on a cold or rainy day. Imagine cooking this simple meal on a rainy day, while you stay snug and warm inside your luxury condominium in Davao. Truly one of the best comforting meals you can have in the city.</p>

            <h3>SINUGLAW</h3>
            <p>Love having fish and meat together? Then Sinuglaw is a Davao food that is right up your alley. Sinuglaw is a combination of sinugba and kinilaw. This dish consists of fresh tuna marinated in vinegar, chilies, onions, ginger, and lime. This is then topped with grilled pork marinated in soy sauce and kalamansi. Some might consider this quite a strange combination of flavors, but the fresh and tart flavors of kinilaw cut beautifully through the meatiness and smokiness of grilled pork.

Your first bite of sinuglaw will have you looking for a condo for sale in Davao so you can move in and have this delicious dish weekly. The sweet and savoury flavours of this dish will definitely make you want to live in Davao full-time.</p>

            <h3>DURIAN</h3>
            <p>Davao is famous as the “Durian Capital of the Philippines,” so a trip to this city will not be complete if you without eating durian. Durian is lovingly called “The King of Fruit,” and its spiky outer appearance holds a sweet and creamy fruit inside. Though a lot of people may dislike the durian’s strong smell, its unique taste and custard-like consistency make it a true Davao delicacy.

If eating fresh durian fruit is too overwhelming for you, try the other snacks and desserts that take inspiration from durian. You can try durian candy or durian tarts, which is a Davao food usually bought as pasalubong. These sweet treats are flavored with durian but leave out the strong scent. You can also go for durian ice cream! This would be a refreshing treat especially during sunny summer days.

Want to try durian in something a little more sophisticated? Look for Davao famous delicacies such as durian coffeeccino, durian cheesecake, and durian sans rival.</p>
